\paragraph{Introduction} 

Network devices often rely on distributed protocols, such as BGP, to
make routing decisions. Network operators can enforce routing policies
(that may express security, economic or other concerns) by configuring
what routing protocols devices execute, and how they process routing
messages.  These configurations are expressed in low-level, vendor
specific languages. Combined with the distributed nature of routing
protocols, reasoning about the correctness of the configurations is a
daunting task for operators.  Network verification
\cite{minesweeper,arc} and simulation tools \cite{batfish} have been
proposed to aid operators. Additionally, as those techniques often
face scaling problems, researchers have suggested ways \cite{bonsai} to simplify the complexity of networks.

Regardless of the transformation or reasoning principles used, one
needs to parse the original network configurations as provided by
operators. To tackle the range of vendor-specific configurations,
Batfish \cite{batfish} uses a vendor-agnostic representation of
routing configurations for common protocols, and provides a translation from each vendor's
language to Batfish's representation. Subsequent analysis such as
compression \cite{bonsai}, simulation \cite{batfish} or verification
\cite{minesweeper,arc} can be then performed on top of this
representation.

Batfish has been an indispensable tool for network researchers thanks
to its ability to parse a wide range of configurations from different
vendors. Unfortunately, its intermediate language (IR) falls short of
many language design goals. First, at 105 different expressions and 23
statements Batfish's IR is \emph{massive}. This is a symptom of other
problems in the design of the IR. In particular, the expressions and
structures used are \emph{specialized} to routing protocols. For
example, instead of a set operation that specifies the field of the
attribute to be changed along with its new value, Batfish uses a
different expression to set the local preference of a BGP attribute, a
different expression to set the MED value, and so on. As such,
expressions cannot be \emph{composed} to build other more complex
operations. Besides the explosion in the size of the IR, this poses
another issue: many desirable transformations cannot be expressed
within Batfish's IR. For instance, replacing the \texttt{AS Path}
attribute of BGP with its length can often improve simulation
performance without loss of precision. Yet, this transformation cannot
be expressed within Batfish's current AST, because one cannot alter
the type of the \texttt{AS Path} or the operations on it. Moreover,
understanding the semantics of the language requires deep knowledge of
routing protocols and the intricacies of vendor specific implementations.

Finally, some effects of executing a protocol are not expressed in the
configurations, but are left \emph{implicit} and it's up to the
backend (e.g. the simulator) to correctly capture
them. This makes it difficult to implement new analyses of
configurations, as one has to correctly implement any implicit effects
operations may have.
%Potentially mention that this poses a maintenance problem.

\paragraph{NV: A flexible IR for control plane configurations}

To overcome these limitations, we propose a typed intermediate
language, called NV. NV allows the user to specify the topology of a
network, the type of the routing messages exchanged, and functions
that define how each device processes these messages. The key design
points of NV are its compact size, the compositionality of its
expressions, and the use of standard programming language constructs
(similar to the ones of ML based languages). We have implemented two
different backends to NV, a BDD-based simulator that simulates the
message exchange procedure of distributed routing protocols, and a
SMT-based logical encoding that can verify properties of the
converged state of a network. Furthermore, to improve the
performance of such techniques we have implemented some common
compiler optimizations such as constant unfolding, inlining and
partial evaluation. The small size and the use of standard constructs
with well-defined semantics facilitates the
implementation of such optimizations.

NV is designed to be an IR, but also a verification framework. NV
includes two key features to support this role: 1. symbolic variables
that denote unknowns in the network, 2. assertions to be verified
about the network's converged state. For instance, a symbolic variable
can model a potential link failure, or a routing announcement from an
external peer.

Finally, for NV to be useful, it must be able to (at least) model
commonly used routing protocols, such as BGP and OSPF. One of the
challenges we faced is to find a language that is sufficient to model
in detail these protocols, but that we can also
efficiently compile to BDDs or logical formulas to be verified by an
SMT solver. Currently, we can translate a number of protocol
configurations from Batfish to NV, including eBGP and OSPF, and we are
working towards supporting more complicated protocols such as iBGP.

% On a similar note, Batfish's specialized expressions provide room for
% specialized (in terms of efficiency) interpretations. For example,
% when simulating a network that runs iBGP over some IGP, Batfish will
% not simulate the iBGP part until the IGP has converged. This and other
% similar optimizations help speed up the simulation. In an IR where
% iBGP and IGP are not directly exposed, but rather are build from
% smaller blocks, it is not straightforward to implement such
% optimizations. Exploiting the high-level structure of the
% configurations to -- among other things -- improve the performance of
% the simulation is an important future direction.
\paragraph{Related Work} The design of NV is partly inspired from
routing algebras \cite{routingalgebra,metarouting}. Routing
algebras were originally devised to reason about convergence
properties of protocols, but the main goal of NV is to enable modelling of
protocols and reasoning about routing properties such as reachability,
way-pointing, and fault tolerance.
