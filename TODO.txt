* Translation from batfish. Need to implement RoutingPolicies, iBGP, OSPF redistribution part of RoutingPolicy?

* General purpose constructors & enums. E.g., type protocol = Ospf | Conn | Static | Bgp

* Named fields and type inference

* Arbitrary fixed width integers. Need it to be part of the type: int5
  How does type inference work? Do you always have to specify for constants: e.g., 10u5?
  This will let us optimize the BDD encoding to use fewer bits

* Change the BDD variable ordering for integers to use MSB first

* Add a command line flag to export to json

* Check for recursion
