* Implement the map filter operation for SMT

* Check for captured variables in mapIf

* Cache the bdd transfer function for the function

* Cache and create only a single operation per function

* Fix the bugs in the optimized version of the mtbdd ops

* Check for recursion

* General way to shrink an SRP model by simplifying the symbolic variables
  Related: can we figure out, in the interpreter, what values are unused?
  Then we can remove these from the symbolic values etc.
