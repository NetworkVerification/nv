* Implement the map filter operation

* Check for recursion

* Implement a BDD backend for state set computation
    Should we add to the language a way to say: "the map with everything"?

* Random test data should bias towards constants used in the program

* General way to shrink an SRP model by simplifying the symbolic variables
  Related: can we figure out, in the interpreter, what values are unused?
  Then we can remove these from the symbolic values etc.
