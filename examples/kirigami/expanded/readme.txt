All examples in this directory and its subdirectories are useful for 
understanding how Kirigami's network partitioning behaves by expanding

partitioned behaviour.
These examples can be run without -k, since they don't define a partition
or an interface function. They are simply intended for a high-level
understanding of the basic idea behind partitioning.
