(** A type for transforming the declarations over the old SRP
 ** to declarations for the new partitioned SRP.
 ** The nodes and edges maps help us to remap nodes and edges.
 ** If an old node or edge is not a value in the map,
 ** then we know it has been removed and we can drop it from
 ** the SRP.
 ** The predicates help us keep track of the `interface` predicates
 ** associated with a given new edge, since both inputs and outputs
 ** have associated predicates (required on the hypotheses and
 ** asserted on the output solutions, respectively).
 **
 ** Invariants:
 ** - every value in node_map and edge_map is a valid node or edge
 **   in the new SRP
 **)
